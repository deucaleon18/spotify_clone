# Spotify Clone 

## About the project:

This was my first project on React. I have used the Deezer API ,which is one of the best free API's out there to build a music player. The API even offers various features to like a song, create a playlist and access your favourites. I have used some of the basic hooks of React in this project like the useState and useEffect hooks.

## Building and Accessing: 
<br>

#### You yourself can build this project using the [Deezer API](https://developers.deezer.com/login?redirect=/api) for developers, but as this is currently not supported in India throughout the project even while accessing the API site or logging in to the project a VPN must be turned on.

#### For our project purposes we have used a free VPN connection [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/) ,ans set the region as USA which will give you the access to any Deezer service.

#### The site is currently deployed [here](https://spotify-clone-zeta.vercel.app/), to login and view all the features I request you to turn on the VPN connection.
